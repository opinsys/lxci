# lxCI

Run commands in temporary containers

    lxci trusty-amd64

This will do following

1. Creates a new temporary container based on the existing `trusty-amd64` container<sup>1</sup>
2. Adds user `lxci` to it
3. Boots and waits for the network and ssh server to wake up in it
4. Logins as the `lxci` user over ssh and starts `bash`
5. After the bash command exists the container is destroyed

add `-v` to see details

<sup>1</sup> Create it with `sudo lxc-create -t download -n trusty-amd64 -- --dist ubuntu --release trusty --arch amd64` and install openssh-server into it


To execute custom command instead of bash use `--command COMMAND`

    lxci trusty-amd64 --command hostname

To copy files into the container workspace use `--sync PATH`

    lxci trusty-amd64 --command "ls -l" --sync .

To archive the container on failures add `--archive-on-fail`

    lxci trusty-amd64 --command "exit 2" --archive-on-fail

The archived containers can be listed with `--list-archive`

    lxci --list-archive

To inspect an archived container use `--inspect NAME`

    lxci --inspect NAME

> This will start an interactive shell session in it

To list all other options use `--help`

    lxci --help

### Artifacts

Place any files to `/home/lxci/results` in the container and they will be
copied to `/var/lib/lxci/results/NAME` on the host. Where `NAME` is the name of
the temporary container. Set it with `--name`.

### Workflow with Continuous Integration Systems

lxcCI works really well with Continuous Integration Systems such as Jenkins. We
use it like this with the Jenkins "Execute shell" build

```shell
lxci --name "$JOB_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER" \
    --tag $JOB \
    --archive-on-fail \
    --destroy-archive-on-success \
    --sync . \
    --command "sh ci.sh"

aptirepo-upload "/var/lib/lxci/results/$JOB_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER/"*.deb
rm -r "/var/lib/lxci/results/$JOB_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER/"
```

The `$JOB_NAME` and `$BUILD_NUMBER` are build specific environment variables
set by Jenkins.

`--name "$JOB_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER"` sets the temporary container name

`--tag $JOB` tags the container with the job name so multiple builds of the
same project can be grouped together

`--archive-on-fail` archives the temporary container with the given name if the
build fails for later investigation

`--destroy-archive-on-success` destroys the archived containers with matching
tags when build succeeds. Automatic clean up!

`--sync .` copies the Jenkins project workspace in into the container

`--command "sh ci.sh"` executes the actual build script which is versioned
within the project

[`aptirepo-upload`](https://github.com/opinsys/aptirepo) is used to upload the build artifacts to our apt repository

and finally the build artifacts are removed with plain old `rm`

## Installation

todo

### Making it ridiculously fast with tmpfs

Do you think SSDs are fast?

### Configuration


### Try it with Vagrant

If you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed just clone this
repository and type

    vagrant up

It will create an Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Trusty Tahr) virtual machine with Jenkins
(port 8080), LXC and lxCI ready to go.

## Security

Not.
